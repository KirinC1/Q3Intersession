        <h1>What We Did</h1>
        <p>During this intersession, we made many websites. They were mainly focused on the shelter in place and what is going on with the coronavirus right now.
            But we also went over media that had a positive impact on us in the past, how we would prepare for an event like this in the future, and how we can reduce our stress during times like these. 
            I learned a lot. Even though we weren't able to take an in person class, I was able to work with friends over discord and that helped me learn.
